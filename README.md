## Installation

This installation process covers all steps, as this project aims to be used by biologists who may not be familiar with setting up such projects. For more experienced users, it follows the general process of setting up a virtual environment, activating it, installing dependencies, and running Python scripts. 

1. **Install Python**:

This project uses Python and was developed using Python 3.12.3. Please download Python from the official link: [Python-3.12.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/) by clicking on the version corresponding to your operating system. 

Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation. 

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**:

Option 1 : Using Git for more experienced users

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziraax/PlanktonFlow.git
cd PlanktonFlow-main
```

Option 2 : Using the download button

If you are not familiar with Git, you can simply click the green "<> Code" button and select "Download ZIP". Then, extract the project wherever you want on your computer. 

3. **Create a virtual environment**:

Virtual environments in Python are isolated directories that contain their own Python interpreter and libraries, allowing you to manage dependencies for each project separately. This prevents conflicts between packages required by different projects and ensures reproducible setups. This is especially useful for a project like this, which has many dependencies.

To create a virtual environment, open a terminal in the folder where you downloaded the project and run :

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Here, **.venv** will be the name of the folder holding the virtual environment. 


4. **Activate the Environment**:

Now, depending on your operating system:

- On Windows using your terminal (CMD), type:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On Windows Powershell:

```
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

- On bash (Linux/macOS):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, your terminal will change to show the venv name.

⚠️ If you encounter an error like "Cannot load the file C:\.\TaxoNet\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 because script execution is disabled on this system.", it means that your current script execution policy is blocking scripts by default for security reasons. To fix this issue, type in a Powershell terminal:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
Then activate your virtual environment.

5. **Install Dependencies**:

Type in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

This installs all the packages listed in the file into the virtual environment. This may take several minutes. 

You can confirm it worked by typing:

```bash
pip list
```

6. **(Optional) Log into Weights & Biases**

Weights & Biases provides robust tools for tracking training runs and performing hyperparameter tuning. It is best suited for users with more advanced needs.

```bash
wandb login
``` 
Then follow the instructions. 


## Usages

This chapter goes through all the different ways a user may use the pipeline. The system is designed around YAML configuration files that make it easy to reproduce experiments and manage different setups.

### Dataset used in the study

The pipeline was originally developed for a specific use case at INRAE UMR DECOD (Rennes, France), where it supports ongoing research on monitoring plankton communities, and was later extended and modularized so that it can benefit the scientific community. 

For convenience, we also provide the dataset used in our study. You can download it from [Zenodo - PlanktonFlow76](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16840846) as a starting point, or substitute your own data.


### To preprocess your data

The preprocessing system supports three different data input formats. Choose the configuration that matches your data organization:

#### 1. Hierarchical Data Format (Folder-based)
If your data is organized in folders, where each folder name represents a class:

```bash
python3 run_preprocessing.py --config configs/preprocessing/PreprocessWithHierarchical.yaml
```

Example configuration (`configs/preprocessing/simple_hierarchical.yaml`):
```yaml
# Simple Hierarchical Dataset Preprocessing Configuration
input_source:
  type: "hierarchical"
  data_path: "DATA/your_hierarchical_dataset"
  subdirs: []  # Empty = direct class folders under data_path

preprocessing:
  scalebar_removal:
    enabled: true
    model_path: "models/model_weights/scale_bar_remover/best.pt"
    confidence: 0.4
    img_size: 416
  
  grayscale_conversion:
    enabled: true
    mode: "RGB"
  
  image_filtering:
    min_images_per_class: 100
    max_images_per_class: 4000
    skip_corrupted_images: true
  
  data_splitting:
    train_ratio: 0.7

  processed_path: "DATA/your_dataset_processed"
  final_dataset_path: "DATA/your_dataset_final"
  create_dataset_yaml: true
  
logging:
  wandb_enabled: false   # In most cases, you don't need WandB logging at the preprocessing step
  log_class_distribution: true  
  log_sample_images: false
  log_processing_times: true
```

#### 2. CSV/TSV Mapping Format
If you have a CSV/TSV file mapping image paths to class labels:

```bash
python3 run_preprocessing.py --config configs/preprocessing/PreprocessWithCSV-TSV.yaml
```

Example configuration:
```yaml
# CSV Mapping Dataset Preprocessing Configuration
input_source:
  type: "csv_mapping"
  images_path: "DATA/your_images_directory"
  metadata_file: "DATA/your_labels.csv"
  image_column: "filename"
  label_column: "species"
  separator: ","
  image_path_prefix: ""

preprocessing:
  # Same preprocessing parameters as above
  [...]
      
output:
  base_path: "DATA/your_dataset"
  processed_path: "DATA/your_dataset_processed"
  final_dataset_path: "DATA/your_dataset_final"
  create_dataset_yaml: true
  
logging:
  wandb_enabled: false
  log_class_distribution: true
  log_sample_images: false
  log_processing_times: true
```

#### 3. EcoTaxa Format
For data exported from EcoTaxa platform:

```bash
python3 run_preprocessing.py --config configs/preprocessing/PreprocessWithEcotaxa.yaml
```

Example configuration:
```yaml
# EcoTaxa TSV Preprocessing Configuration
input_source:
  type: "ecotaxa"
  data_path: "DATA/your_ecotaxa_folder"
  metadata_file: "ecotaxa_export_TSV_xxxxx.tsv"
  separator: "\t"

preprocessing:
  # Same preprocessing parameters as above
  [...]

output:
  base_path: "DATA/your_ecotaxa"
  processed_path: "DATA/your_ecotaxa_processed"
  final_dataset_path: "DATA/your_ecotaxa_final"
  create_dataset_yaml: true
  
logging:
  wandb_enabled: false
  log_class_distribution: true
  log_sample_images: false
  log_processing_times: true
```

### To train a model

Training is fully configuration-driven. You can train different model architectures with various hyperparameters.

```bash
python3 run_training.py --config configs/training/TrainDefault{modelName}.yaml
```

#### Basic Training Example

Example configuration (`configs/training/TrainDefaultEfficientNet.yaml`):
```yaml
# ============================================================
# EfficientNet B5 Training Configuration
# ============================================================

run_name: "efficientnet_b5_experiment"  # Custom run name in case you don't want it to be generated

# DATA CONFIGURATION
data:
  dataset_path: "DATA/your_dataset_final"  # Path to preprocessed dataset
  
# PROJECT CONFIGURATION
project:
  name: "YOLOv11Classification500"     # W&B project name
  
# MODEL CONFIGURATION
model:
  name: "efficientnet"      # Options: "efficientnet", "resnet", "densenet", "yolov11"
  variant: "b5"             # EfficientNet variants: "b0"-"b7"
  pretrained: true          # Use pretrained weights

  epochs: 50                   # Number of training epochs
  optimizer: "adamw"           # Options: "adam", "adamw", "sgd", "rmsprop"
  early_stopping_patience: 15  # Early stopping patience
  device: "cuda"               # Options: "cuda", "cpu", "auto"
  num_workers: 8               # Number of data loader workers

# LOSS CONFIGURATION
loss:
  type: "focal"                # Options: "focal", "labelsmoothing", "weighted"
  focal_alpha: 1.0             # Focal loss alpha parameter
  focal_gamma: 2.0             # Focal loss gamma parameter
  use_per_class_alpha: true    # Use per-class weights

# WEIGHTS & BIASES CONFIGURATION
wandb:
  log_results: true            # Enable W&B logging
  tags: ["efficientnet", "b5", "production"]
  notes: "Production training run"
```

Training will always compute metrics on the test set at the end.

#### Advanced Training Features

**Multiple Model Architectures:**
- **EfficientNet**: `variant: "b0"` to `"b7"`
- **ResNet**: `variant: "18"`, `"34"`, `"50"`, `"101"`, `"152"`
- **DenseNet**: `variant: "121"`, `"161"`, `"169"`, `"201"`
- **YOLOv11**: `name: "yolov11"`

**Loss Functions:**
```yaml
# Focal Loss (good for imbalanced datasets)
loss:
  type: "focal"
  focal_gamma: 2.0
  focal_alpha: 1.0
  use_per_class_alpha: true

# Label Smoothing
loss:
  type: "labelsmoothing"
  labelsmoothing_epsilon: 0.12

# Weighted Cross-Entropy (automatic class balancing)
loss:
  type: "weighted"

```

**Training Without Weights & Biases:**
```yaml
# Disable W&B for offline training
wandb:
  log_results: false
  tags: ["production", "efficientnet", "b5", "label_smoothing"]
  notes: "Production EfficientNet B5 with label smoothing"

run_name: "offline_experiment"

# All metrics and plots will be saved locally to:
# model_weights/{model_name}/{variant}/{run_name}/
```

### Inference (Making predictions)

Use trained models to make predictions on new images.

```bash
python3 run_inference.py --config configs/inference/your_inference_config.yaml
```


Example configuration (`configs/inference/DefaultInference.yaml`):
```yaml
# Model Configuration
model:
  name: "efficientnet"      # Model architecture: "efficientnet", "resnet", "densenet", "yolov11"
  variant: "b5"             # Model variant
  weights_path: "model_weights/efficientnet/b5/my_experiment/best.pt"
  num_classes: 76           # Number of classes (must match training)

# Dataset YAML for Class Names
dataset_yaml: "DATA/final_dataset/dataset.yaml"  # <-- Path to the YAML file containing class names
  # This file is generated automatically during preprocessing.
  # It MUST match the dataset used for training this model.
  # The class names will be read from the 'names' field in this YAML.

# Inference Configuration
inference:
  image_dir: "path/to/new/images"        # Directory containing images to predict
  batch_size: 32                        # Inference batch size
  top_k: 5                              # Return top K predictions per image
  device: "cuda"                        # Device: "cuda", "cpu", "auto"
  save_csv: true                        # Save results as CSV
  output_path: "outputs/predictions.csv" # Output file path

# Optional preprocessing during inference
preprocessing:
  scalebar_removal: true                # Apply scalebar removal if needed
  
# Weights & Biases Configuration
wandb:
  log_results: false                    # Usually disabled for inference
  tags: ["inference", "production"]
  notes: "Production inference run"
```


**How class names are handled:**
- The `dataset_yaml` field in your inference config should point to the YAML file generated during preprocessing (e.g., `DATA/final_dataset/dataset.yaml`).
- The system will read the class names from the `names` field in this YAML, ensuring the class order matches what was used during training.
- This prevents label mismatches and makes inference robust to changes in the dataset structure.

**Inference Output:**
- CSV file with detailed predictions and confidence scores (specified in `output_path`)
- Predictions include top-K classes with probabilities for each image
- Optional scalebar preprocessing applied automatically if enabled


If your dataset matches ours (see [Zenodo-PlanktonFlow76](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16840846) and the related paper [PlanktonFlow: hands-on, deep-learning classification of plankton images for biologists](https://doi.org/fake.doi) (as of 26.08.25, the preprint is not yet published)), you may want to use our best performing model. 
The model parameters can be found in the supplementary archive at [PlanktonFlow: Supplementary Information](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16902839). You will need to place the best model parameters in the correct folder, namely, ```model_weights/efficientnet/b5/{name}/```, and modify the inference configuration file accordingly. The model is trained on 76 classes; the class names can be found in: ```DATA/final_dataset/dataset.yaml```. 

### Hyperparameter Optimization

Perform automated hyperparameter sweeps using Weights & Biases:

```bash
python3 run_sweep.py --sweep_config configs/sweeps/densenet_sweep.yaml
```

Example sweep configuration (`configs/sweeps/densenet_sweep.yaml`):
```yaml
# Sweep configuration
program: run_sweep.py
method: bayes  # or random, grid
metric:
  name: val/metrics/accuracy_top1
  goal: maximize

# Fixed parameters
parameters:
  model_name:
    value: densenet
  epochs:
    value: 30
  device:
    value: cuda

  # Parameters to optimize
  densenet_variant:
    values: [121, 161, 169, 201]
  
  batch_size:
    values: [32, 64]
    
  learning_rate:
    distribution: log_uniform_values
    min: 1e-6
    max: 1e-3
    
  loss_type:
    values: ["focal", "labelsmoothing", "weighted"]
    
  # Focal loss parameters (when applicable)
  focal_gamma:
    distribution: uniform
    min: 1.0
    max: 3.0
```

**Running Sweeps:**
1. The sweep automatically creates multiple training runs
2. Each run tests different hyperparameter combinations
3. Results are logged to Weights & Biases for comparison
4. Best configurations are automatically identified
5. When you are satisfied with the results, you can stop the sweep in the terminal.

### Quick Start Examples

**Complete Workflow Example:**
```bash
# 1. Preprocess your data
python3 run_preprocessing.py --config configs/preprocessing/PreprocessWithHierarchical.yaml

# 2. Train a model
python3 run_training.py --config configs/training/TrainDefaultEfficientNet.yaml

# 3. Make predictions
python3 run_inference.py --config configs/inference/DefaultInference.yaml
```

### Reproducing Results

To facilitate reproducibility, we provide configuration files for all models and their corresponding hyperparameters in the ```configs/reproduce_paper``` directory. Using these training configurations together with the preprocessed dataset available at [Zenodo-PlanktonFlow76](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16840846) should enable you to reliably reproduce the results presented in the paper.


## Results and monitoring

### Monitoring 

If you choose not to use Weights & Biases, our custom monitoring module will collect training data and write it to a log file in real time, allowing you to monitor your runs as they progress.

The file will be saved at: `model_weights/{model_name}/{variant}/{run_name}/training_log.txt`. 

Example: 

```yaml
Training Log - Reproduce_best_model_20250814_141638
============================================================

    4 |     1.2635 |   1.2551 |    0.8603 |    0.9892 |   0.8375 |       0.8534 |          0.8298 | 9.98e-06
```

This same data is also stored in `training_log.csv` for further analysis.

### Results

A notebook named `results_analysis.ipynb` is available to further analyze training metrics and inference results.
To adapt it to your own runs, modify the first cell as follows: 

```python
# Replace with your model path
MODEL_DIR = "model_weights/{model_name}/{variant}/{run_name}"
TRAINING_LOG_PATH = f"{MODEL_DIR}/training_log.csv"
CLASSIF_REPORT = f"{MODEL_DIR}/classification_report.csv"
```

Once updated, click on Run All to generate figures and insights about your classification model and training process, including:

- Validation & training loss over epochs
- Evolution of accuracies over epochs
- Metrics over epochs
- F1-score vs. support
- Best and worst classified classes
- Confusion matrix
- Most frequently confused classes

This is a starter kit to evaluate your model, which can be easily extended for more advanced analyses.
